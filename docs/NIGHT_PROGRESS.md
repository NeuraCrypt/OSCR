# Night run: progress journal

The mission is `docs/NIGHT_RUN.md`. This journal is enough to resume: read it, then continue
from "Next step".

## How the night runs

- **Where**: the git worktree `/Volumes/Expansion/Scrapper/.worktrees/night`. Never switch the
  branch of the production checkout `/Volumes/Expansion/Scrapper`: it stays on `main`, and the
  harvester and the 04:17 nightly publication run from it.
- **Branches**: `night/phase-XX-name`, one per phase, each built on the previous one. They are
  pushed to GitHub. Nothing is merged into `main`, and nothing is deployed.
- **Orchestration**: one Workflow per phase, launched by the main Claude session.
- **Scratch outputs**: agents write their intermediate outputs under `data/night/`
  (git-ignored). If a session died mid-phase, look there and at `git status` before redoing
  work.
- **Fallback**: `./nuit.sh`, at the root of this worktree, relaunches headless sessions that
  resume from this journal. Start it only if no main session is orchestrating.
- `science.css` is at `website/src/styles/science.css`.
- **Tests at every commit**:
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` and `.venv/bin/ruff check oscr tests tools`;
  - in `website/`: `npm test` under the default Node and under Node 22 (CI), at
    `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Volumes-Expansion-Scrapper/2afc683b-88a8-4f04-89f2-a048bee9e298/scratchpad/tscheck/node_modules/node/bin`;
  - then `CATALOG_DIR=<worktree>/tests/fixtures/public-catalog npm run build` and
    `npm run check -- --every-route`.

## Phases

| phase | branch | state |
|---|---|---|
| 00 research and architecture | night/phase-00-research | in progress (Workflow night-phase-00) |

## Next step

Phase 00 is in progress:
- the GitHub feature inventory (`data/night/parity/` → `docs/GITHUB_PARITY.md`);
- the Git storage choice (`data/night/storage/` → `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`);
- the plan (`docs/PLATFORM_PLAN.md`);
- the `GitBackend` abstraction.
